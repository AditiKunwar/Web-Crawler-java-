# Web-Crawler-java-

Crawling of data from the Web and later to store it in our self-created dataset is done in java.
I done this in java because I have to create a frontend and i'm learning Javascript. So, it will be learning experience for me to creating a frontend and later to go for relational databases of AWS or GCP.
